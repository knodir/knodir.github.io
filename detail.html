      				<p>I received my <b>Master of Science</b> at the Embedded Computing Laboratory of <a href="http://www.konkuk.ac.kr/eng/" target="_blank">Konkuk University</a>, from September of 2008 to August of 2010 in Seoul, South Korea. My supervisor was Professor Kim Doo-Hyun.</p>
      				<p>My <a href="files/papers/graduate-thesis.pdf" target="_blank">thesis</a> title was <b>Enhancing eCos with EDF Scheduling and Lock-Free buffer</b>, which was developed as a part of <i>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Software</i> project supported by Ministry of Knowledge Economy, Korea. I designed and implemented a new kernel scheduling algorithm for <a href="http://ecos.sourceware.org" target="_blank">eCos</a> (Embedded Configurable Operating System). It was great RTOS to get hands-on experience at embedded operating system kernel and application development.</p>

      			<li class="pub_list">I earned <b>Bachelors degree</b> at Information Technology department of <a href="http://www.tuit.uz/">Tashkent University of Information Technologies</a>, from September of 2004 to June of 2008 in Tashkent, Uzbekistan. My supervisor was Professor Rustam Khamdamov. </li>

          <h3>Work experience</h3>
      		<ul class="publications">
            <li class="pub_list">
              <p>I was at <a href="https://www.zerostack.com/" target="_blank">ZeroStack</a> for 18 months starting from May 2015. I started as a Summer intern for four months, which then became a longer relationship involving combination of intern and consulting engineer roles. During this time we grew from 10 engineers in sunny Mountain View, CA to over 35 engineers in Califonia and India.</p>

              <p>At ZeroStack, I worked on many exciting projects related to building an enterprise private cloud. I started by evaluating and fine-tuning OpenStack networking (Neutron) for performance and scalability. As a by-product I developed OpenStack network benchmark framework. Then I focused on building network and storage QoS private cloud enterprise workloads, which involved evaluating and fine-tuning several (clustered) applications, such as Hadoop, Memcache, Redis, MySQL and Jenkins for improved performance. Some of my contributions were around better VM and volume placement, where I developed OpenStack Cinder scheduler(s) to provide VM and storage locality.</p> 

      			<li class="pub_list">
      				<p>I joined <b>Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute</b> <a href="http://www.etri.re.kr/eng/main/index.etri" target="_blank">(ETRI)</a> at Daejeon, South Korea as an engineer/researcher on September of 2010. ETRI is South Korea's largest research center for Information and Communication technologies. I enjoyed ETRI environment until July of 2013, during which I worked mainly on <b>Cloud Data Center Networking</b> and <b>Cloud Computing Resource Management</b> projects.</p>
      				</p><b>Cloud Data Center Networking</b> project's scope was to automate/optimize virtual machine networking. My responsibility was to developed Edge Control Protocol (ECP), and Virtual Station Interface Discovery and Configuration Protocol (VDP) on <a href="http://www.ipinfusion.com/products/zebos-network-platform" target="_blank">ZebOS Network Platform</a>. Both of these protocols are based on <a href="http://www.ieee802.org/1/pages/802.1bg.html" target="_blank">IEEE 801.1Qbg</a> Edge Virtual Bridging (EVB) standard. While in project I got a good insight on:
      				<ul>
      					<li>Ethernet (L2) network protocol design, development;</li>
      					<li>Embedded systems architecture, development for networking equipment;</li>
      					<li>As an early adopter of the standard, contribute to the IEEE 801.1Qbg by editing MIB variables, state machine diagram and other minor text revisions;</li>
      				</ul></p>
      				<p>In <b>Cloud Computing Resource Management</b> project we built a framework to manage compute, storage and network of the virtual machines. As one of the core developers, I was involved in:
    					<ul>
    						<li>Designing management software architecture for the heterogeneous cloud environment, which included monitoring and provisioning of the cloud resources for <a href="https://www.eucalyptus.com/" target="_blank">Eucalyptus</a>, <a href="http://opennebula.org/" target="_blank">OpenNebula</a> and <a href="http://www.openstack.org/" target="_blank">OpenStack</a> cloud IaaS platforms;</li>
    						<li>Develop broker agent for connecting Cloud Management software stack to Eucalyptus, OpenNebula and OpenStack open source cloud platforms;</li>
    					</ul>
    					I also had a chance to play with <a href="http://libcloud.apache.org/" target="_blank">Libcloud</a> and <a href="http://deltacloud.apache.org/" target="_blank">Deltacloud</a> for interacting with multiple clouds from single API, develop cloud management application using those APIs, and use <a href="http://www.zabbix.com/" target="_blank">Zabbix</a>, <a href="http://ganglia.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">Ganglia</a> to monitor Data Center resources.</p>

        	<h3>Awards/Honors</h3>
      		<ul class="publications">
            <li class="pub_list">After successful defence of my <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/students/grad/prospective/programs/phd#rpe">RPE</a> on September of 2014, I was awarded <a href="https://www.grad.ubc.ca/awards/four-year-doctoral-fellowship-4yf">Four Year Doctoral Fellowship</a> by the Graduate Studies of the University of British Columbia. This award guarantees a financial support of at least $18,000 per year plus tuition for the first four years of my PhD studies.</li>

    				<li class="pub_list">Right after my undergraduates, I was awarded <b>Korean Government IT Scholarship Program </b> for International Graduate Students sponsored by <i>Institute for Information Technology Advancement (IITA)</i> under <i>National IT Industry Promotion Agency</i> (NIPA) Korea on September of 2008. Award covered full tuiton and living expenses for 2 years, to get master's degree at Korean university.</li>
      			
            <li class="pub_list">During senior years of my undergraduates, November of 2007, I was awarded <b>outstanding student-researcher in technology/engineering</b> scholarship named after <b>Biruni</b>. It is provided by Ministry of Higher and Secondary Education, Uzbekistan, and is highly competitive national award for engineering students. Annually Biruni is awarded to only handful of students, whose achievements are highly acknowledged by local/global scientific community. Award doubles monthly stipend for a year, and importantly, guarantees fully funded graduate admission (entrance exam waived) at any university of Uzbekistan.</li>

            <li class="pub_list">For my undergraduates, I was lucky to get <b>merit-based study scholarship</b> funded by Uzbekistan government. Annually, it is awarded to the top 20 percent of the nationwide university entrance exam applicants. I was honored to have a fully-funded bachelor degree at <a href="http://www.tuit.uz/" target="_blank">Tashkent University of Information Technologies</a> from September of 2004 to July of 2008.</li>
