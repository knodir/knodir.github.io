        <h3><a href="https://www.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca/~cs317/X/index.html" target="_blank">CPSC 317: Internet Computing</a></h3>
        <p>This course was provided mostly to the third year undergraduate 
        students to learn and get hands-on experience with networked systems. I was at the backstage, marking assignments related to FTP client, FTP server and DNS resolver client. Course 
        instructor was <a href="https://www.cs.ubc.ca/people/donald-acton" target="_blank">
        Donald Acton</a>.</p>

        <h3><a href="https://piazza.com/ubc.ca/spring2013/cpsc416" target="_blank">CPSC 416: Distributed Systems</a></h3>
        <p>This was an assignment and exam based course for senior (4th year) 
        undergraduate students. I was one of two TAs. Course covered range of 
        topics in distributed system, such as vector clocks, concurrent data 
        access algorithms/mechanisms, monitors, message passing in a parallel 
        systems and etc. In an addition to exam marking, I was responsible for 
        a design, execution and evaluation of the two assignments. The first 
        assignment was about getting an experience with a concurrent process 
        exection and sharing data between them. The second assignment was 
        about a fault-tolerance in distributed system. Here students did an 
        experiment with Apache Zookeeper by writing their <a href="http://cyberroadie.wordpress.com/2011/11/24/implementing-leader-election-with-zookeeper/" target="_blank">modified 
        version</a> of a leader election algorithm. Course instructor was 
        <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~wagner/" target="_blank">Alan S. Wagner</a>.

        <h3><a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ubccpsc2102013w1/" target="_blank">CPSC 210: Software Construction</a></h3>
        <p>This course was provided mostly to the second year undergraduate 
        students to learn Java and make a class project. My responsibilities 
        were to supervise labs, mark exams and hold office hours to answer 
        questions related to class project and Java in general. Course 
        instructors were <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphy/" target="_blank">
        Gail Murphy</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~bestchai/" target="_blank">Ivan Beschastnikh</a>.</p>
